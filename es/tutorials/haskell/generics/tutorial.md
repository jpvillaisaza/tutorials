This tutorial will get you up to speed with GHC generics quickly. It should
be noted that generics is not something academic and useless, quite the
contrary, it's a very pragmatic way to reduce the amount of boilerplate (and
associated with it errors) in your functional code with minimal mental
overhead. In fact, by the time you get to the end of the tutorial, I hope
you'll agree that generics are easy to use and easy “to get” as well. The
tutorial is for intermediate-level Haskellers.

Let's start from the beginning. What are generics? **Generics**, like in
other languages, **are a way to use the same code to manipulate different
data types**. We should note that in this regard the technique is very close
to the much more common notion of polymorphism, which in Haskell comes in
two flavors:

* **Parametric polymorphism**, when we have type variables in functions/data
  types. This allows the same function, such as `const` to work with any
  types of arguments, as long as the more general types from a function's
  signature can be made equal to concrete types we want to work with by
  instantiating/fixing the type variables.

* **Ad-hoc polymorphism**, which allows us to perform a computation
  abstracted over instances of one or more type classes. We request that a
  type has some properties of interest and then describe the computation in
  terms of these properties. The code is then applicable to any data type
  that has the properties.

How are generics different? Generics allow us to describe transformation
that works in terms of not concrete types, but general combinators that
describe shape and meta information about a data type. This way, we can
declare how to perform a computation on almost any data type!

## The idea about generics

Haskell's features that open the possibility for such a thing as generics
are type classes and ad-hoc polymorphism. The ability to describe a data
type in terms of a set of combinators is our property, encapsulated by the
`Generic` type class. A data type that is an instance of the type class can
be processed by functions that work with a representation of data type, not
the data type itself. These functions, however, are by definition
polymorphic and also usually hidden behind a type class interface, so the
whole thing usually takes the form of automatic deriving of a type class
instance.

The process can be described like this:

1. A given data type gets `Generic` instance automatically, as it can be
   generated by the compiler with the help of the `DeriveGeneric` language
   extension.

2. There is a type class instance defined for instances of `Generic` (or
   `Generic1`). Since our data type is now an instance of those type
   classes, that generics-based instance starts to work for us and we
   magically get all the useful methods of that type class.

If you know about `Data` and `Typeable` type classes, then you probably know
that it's possible to do something similar using information which methods
of those type classes provide. `Data` and `Typeable` are beyond the scope of
this tutorial, but you read about them in
this [blog post by Chris Done](http://chrisdone.com/posts/data-typeable) if
you're interested.

Step 2 is not as simple as it sounds though, at least not until we examine
the details of this business more closely.

## Combinators that represent the shape of a data type

What could they look like? Well, if I showed you the data types as they are
right now, you would probably run away in fear, cursing the tutorial and
Haskell's generics. I have a better idea. Let's start with the simplest
thing possible and then iterate asking ourselves how to work around some
more interesting use cases that we might need to support. This will force us
to make the data types more hairy but also more powerful step by step, till
we arrive at the definitions that are actually used.

For better or worse, algebraic data types lock us into a view on the world
that consists of sums and products (another Haskell's feature that makes the
existence of generics framework possible; generics do not work with GADTs
for example). So we need to be able to represent the following:

* Data types without constructors at all: uninhabited types like `Void`.
  This can be described as `data V1` (note: it has no constructors).

* Constructors without arguments. Let this be something like this: `data U1
  = U1`.

* Sums: `data (f :+: g) = L1 f | R1 g`. If we have a sum data type with two
  alternatives we can represent other sum data types with any number of
  alternatives using nesting.

* Products: `data (f :*: g) = f :*: g`.

Not bad for a start. Let's try use this representation to derive a `Functor`
instance. Deriving a such an instance means that we should provide the
`fmap` function which looks like this:

```haskell
fmap :: (a -> b) -> Rep f -> Rep f
```

Here, `Rep f` maps to the type of generic representation of `f :: * -> *`.
There is a problem though. You see, the functor's inner type that goes from
`a` to `b` in this example has no place to live in the representation! Our
current approach will work only for type classes that work with things of
kind `*`, such as `Show`, but if we want to use this system to derive a
`Functor` instance, we need to allow it to work with kind `* -> *`.

We want to be able to derive `Functor` (and similar) instances generically,
so we have to fix things up. The solution is to add one more type parameter
`p` to all our combinators:

```haskell
data V1 p
data U1 p = U1
data (f :+: g) p = L1 (f p) | R1 (g p)
data (f :*: g) p = (f p) :*: (g p)
```

This way `fmap` would be:

```haskell
fmap :: (a -> b) -> Rep f a -> Rep f b
--                  p  =  a    p  =  b
```

But what happens to the type classes that work with `*` kinds? Here are our
choices:

* Have a separate set of combinator types for each case (`*` and `* -> *`
  kinds).

* Use the most general form (with `p`), but for `*` kinds just treat the
  extra `p` parameter as a dummy type index that has no meaning.

The authors of the generic extension went with the second option, and I
can't blame them. We'll see that there are a lot of wrappers already and we
really should try to keep their number from exploding any further (this may
make more sense on the second read).

Let's try to map from a data type to its representation and see if we're
still missing something:

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

-- Interestingly, we could build a representation that works on ‘Maybe a’,
-- that is, a thing of kind *, if we wanted to derive something like ‘Show’.
-- At the same time if we wanted to derive ‘Functor’, we would work with
-- ‘Maybe’ of kind * -> *. This means that there are actually two different
-- possible representations depending on our aim. This is addressed with two
-- different generics type classes, as we will see later.

-- For kind *, things like ‘Show’:

-- type: (U1 :+: ?) p
```

Oh, how to represent `Just a`? We need to way to allow it have an argument!
Let's add the following:

```haskell
data Rec0 c p = Rec0 { unRec0 :: c }
```

`Rec` part in the type's name hints that this thing may be possibly
recursive.

But I'm lying to you, due to some historical stuff, it's defined a bit
differently:

```haskell
type Rec0 = K1 R

newtype K1 i c p = K1 { unK1 :: c } -- c is the value, ‘a’ in ‘Maybe a’
--         ^   ^
--         |   |
--         |   +-------- dummy p
--         |
-- type-level tag, R or P
```

You see this `R` type-level tag? There used to be another one, `P` and this
`type Par0 = K1 P` type synonym, but forget it, it's deprecated. Bottom
line: `Rec0` is used for data constuctor arguments (fields), that **are
not** `p` parameter.

With `Rec0`, we can finally build representation of `Maybe a`:

```haskell
-- This is the type of our representation: (U1 :+: Rec0 a) p

-- Examples of values for ‘Maybe Int’:

-- Nothing => L1 U1
-- Just 5  => R1 (K1 5) -- remember where K1 comes from?
--            ^
--            |
--            +--- L1 and R1 are from our representation of sum types
```

Let's derive a different representation that works with `* -> *` kinds:

```haskell
-- Type of our representation: (U1 :+: ?) p
```

We need a way to tell if we have an argument of `p` type (like `a` in
`Functor f => f a`) or some other type, if we're to write a generic
`Functor` function. For this reason the generics extension uses `Par1 p`:

```haskell
newtype Par1 p = Par1 { unPar1 :: p } -- “par” stands for “parameter”
```

`Par1` is used to mark occurrences of `p`. Our representation thus becomes:

```haskell
-- The type of our representation: (U1 :+: Par1) p

-- Examples of values for ‘Maybe Int’:

-- Nothing => L1 U1 -- the same
-- Just 5  => R1 (Par1 5)
```

Almost there. The final example is that for lists. Given the standard
definition of linked list:

```haskell
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

How do we build its representation (for kind `* -> *`)? The tricky part is,
of course, `List a`, which is a recursive occurrence of entire functorish
part with parameter inside it. If we mark occurrences of parameter by
wrapping them with `Par1`, then why not mark this thing with something too?
`Rec1` shall it be.

```haskell
-- The type of representation: (U1 :+: (Par1 :*: Rec1 List)) p

-- Examples of values for ‘List Int’:

-- Nil                 => L1 U1
-- Cons 5 Nil          => R1 (Par1 5 :*: Rec1 Nil)
-- Cons 5 (Cons 4 Nil) => R1 (Par1 5 :*: Rec1 (Cons 4 Nil))
```

If we had just arguments of a data constructor that are not related to
parameter `p`, plain `Rec0` (`K1`) would be used for both first and second
arguments of `Cons`.

And that's it, we have everything we need.

## The `Generic` and `Generic1` type classes

Type classes that map types to their representations are called `Generic`
(for type classes that work with `*` kinds) and `Generic1` (for type classes
that work with `* -> *` kinds). They live in the module called
`GHC.Generics` together with the types used to build the data type
representations we've just discussed.

Let's see what these type classes have:

```haskell
class Generic a where
  type Rep a :: * -> *
  from :: a -> Rep a p
  to   :: Rep a p -> x

class Generic1 f where
  type Rep1 f :: * -> *
  from1 :: f p -> Rep1 f p
  to1   :: Rep1 f p -> f p
```

`from` and `from1` map values of data types to their generic
representations. `Rep` and `Rep1` are associated type functions (the feature
is a part of the `TypeFamilies` GHC extension) that take the type of data we
want to manipulate and yield the type of its representation. Of course, if
we want to derive `Functor` instances, we need a way to go back from
representation to actual value of target data type. This is done via `to`
and `to1`. The good thing about this, of course, that GHC can derive
`Generic` and `Generic1` for us automatically with `DeriveGeneric` language
extension enabled.

Now let's open GHCi and try to infer `Rep` of some type:

```haskell
λ> :t (undefined :: Rep (List a) p)
(undefined :: Rep (List a) p)
  :: D1
       ('MetaData "List" "GenericsTutorial" "main" 'False)
       (C1 ('MetaCons "Nil" 'PrefixI 'False) U1
        :+: C1
              ('MetaCons "Cons" 'PrefixI 'False)
              (S1
                 ('MetaSel
                    'Nothing 'NoSourceUnpackedness 'NoSourceStrictness 'DecidedLazy)
                 (Rec0 a)
               :*: S1
                     ('MetaSel
                        'Nothing 'NoSourceUnpackedness 'NoSourceStrictness 'DecidedLazy)
                     (Rec0 (List a))))
       p
```

Ah OK, there is just a little bit more to this representation thing…

## Metadata wrappers

A representation also has associated metadata. It may look messy and
difficult to read, but I'll explain the logic behind it in a moment, it
should help to clarify why it's done like this.

First of all, metadata should not get in our way if we don't want to deal
with it. Thus all metadata is attached using the same simple wrapper:

```haskell
newtype M1 i c f p = M1 { unM1 :: f p } -- ‘f p’ is what lives inside, U1 for example
--         ^ ^
--         | |
--         | +---- compiler-generated data type that allows us to get meta information
--         |
--  type-level tag, see below
```

The `i` type-level tag can be one of the three:

* `D` for data type metadata `type D1 = M1 D`
* `C` for constructor metadata `type C1 = M1 C`
* `S` for record selector metadata `type S1 = M1 S`

It should be understandable why metadata is attached this way. If we want
to, we can ignore metadata easily, since it's just a wrapper:

```haskell
f (M1 x) = f x
```

If we want to look at a particular type of metadata we can specify the `i`
type-level tag, or we can leave it unspecified to deal with all metadata at
once.

The `c` type is auto-generated by the compiler and encodes metadata on type
level. Why not store the metadata on value level, in `M1` constructor? Well,
if it were there, we would have to provide it if we wanted to generate some
values, and providing metadata for already existing data type is certainly
something that only the compiler can do properly. With the current approach,
a given data type determines the type of its representation, including its
metadata, so we don't have to bother.

The last thing to mention about metadata is which wrappers are generated for
you. They are very predictable:

* The entire representation is wrapped in `D1`, which provides
  datatype-level information (datatype name, module name, and whether it's a
  `newtype`).

* Every constructor is wrapped in `C1`, which provides information about
  constructor (such as constructor name, fixity, and whether it's a record).

* Every argument of constructor is wrapped with `S1` (even if it's not
  actually a record selector), which tells us the selector name.

Look
[at the Haddock](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.2.0/docs/GHC-Generics.html#t:Datatype),
to find out names of functions that help extract the metadata. Using them is
straightforward: feed the wrapped data to functions like `datatypeName` and
get the information.

## Example: `Functor` deriving

Of course, after talking so much about `Functor` instances and adding the
clumsy `p` parameter to support them, we absolutely must to derive `Functor`
instance for generics! Anyway, `Functor` instance for generics is already
defined in `GHC.Generics`, so instead of re-implementing it, let's just go
through the code:

```haskell
-- If we have a parameter ‘p’, we just map over it, as expected:

instance Functor Par1 where
  fmap f (Par1 p) = Par1 (f p)

-- The same with ‘Rec1’ (just use ‘fmap’ because the inner part is a ‘Functor’):

instance Functor f => Functor (Rec1 f) where
  fmap f (Rec1 a) = Rec 1 (fmap f a)

-- A constructor without fields only can be returned untouched:

instance Functor U1 where
  fmap _ U1 = U1

-- A field that is not ‘p’ parameter should not change:

instance Functor (K1 i c) where
  fmap _ (K1 a) = a

-- Metadata has no effect, just unwrap it and continue with the inner value,
-- if the inner value is an instance of ‘Functor’:

instance Functor f => Functor (M1 i c f) where
  fmap f (M1 a) = M1 (fmap f a)

-- When we have a sum, we should try to map what we get, provided that it
-- contains something that has ‘Functor’ instance:

instance (Functor l, Functor r) => Functor (l :+: r) where
  fmap f (L1 a) = L1 (fmap f a)
  fmap f (R1 a) = R1 (fmap f a)

-- The same for products:

instance (Functor a, Functor b) => Functor (a :*: b) where
  fmap f (a :*: b) = fmap f a :*: fmap f b
```

## Example: counting constructor fields

I think now we're dangerous enough to implement a simple (and pretty
useless) type class that will count constructor fields of a given value.
(Yeah, I could go with the venerable `Encode` example here, but I like to be
“original”, so you get a dumber example instead :-D)

The type class looks like this:

```haskell
class CountFields a where
  -- | Return number of constuctor fields for a value.
  countFields :: a -> Natural
```

We will start by implementing `countFields` method that works on
representations:

```haskell
instance CountFields (V1 p) where
  countFields _ = 0

instance CountFields (U1 p) where
  countFields _ = 0

instance CountFields (K1 i c p) where
  countFields _ = 1

instance CountFields (f p) => CountFields (M1 i c f p) where
  countFields (M1 x) = countFields x

instance (CountFields (a p), CountFields (b p)) => CountFields ((a :+: b) p) where
  countFields (L1 x) = countFields x
  countFields (R1 x) = countFields x

instance (CountFields (a p), CountFields (b p)) => CountFields ((a :*: b) p) where
  countFields (a :*: b) = countFields a + countFields b
```

Let's write a single function called, say, `defaultCountFields` that does
the whole thing:

```haskell
defaultCountFields :: (Generic a, CountFields (Rep a)) => a -> Natural
defaultCountFields = countFields . from
```

But here is the catch, the code above does not compile. `CountFields` has
the kind `CountFields :: * -> Constraint`, but we give it `Rep a` of kind `*
-> *`. It's not going to take our abuse like this!

The solution, typical with this setting, is to have a helper class that
works with things of `* -> *` kind (this also removes the `p` parameters
from signatures):

```haskell
class CountFields1 f where
  countFields1 :: f p -> Natural

defaultCountFields :: (Generic a, CountFields1 (Rep a)) => a -> Natural
defaultCountFields = countFields1 . from

instance CountFields1 V1 where
  countFields1 _ = 0

instance CountFields1 U1 where
  countFields1 _ = 0

instance CountFields1 (K1 i c) where
  countFields1 _ = 1

instance CountFields1 f => CountFields1 (M1 i c f) where
  countFields1 (M1 x) = countFields1 x

instance (CountFields1 a, CountFields1 b) => CountFields1 (a :+: b) where
  countFields1 (L1 x) = countFields1 x
  countFields1 (R1 x) = countFields1 x

instance (CountFields1 a, CountFields1 b) => CountFields1 (a :*: b) where
  countFields1 (a :*: b) = countFields1 a + countFields1 b
```

You could notice that some data types like `Par0`, `Rec1` didn't get their
definitions. This is OK because we work with `Generic`, not `Generic1` here,
but omitting definitions for some data types that generic representations
are built from is normal. As `GHC.Generics` docs say:

* If no `:+:` instance is given, the function may still work for empty
  datatypes or datatypes that have a single constructor, but will fail on
  datatypes with more than one constructor.

* If no `:*:` instance is given, the function may still work for datatypes
  where each constructor has just zero or one field, in particular for
  enumeration types.

* If no `K1` instance is given, the function may still work for enumeration
  types, where no constructor has any fields.

* If no `V1` instance is given, the function may still work for any datatype
  that is not empty.

* If no `U1` instance is given, the function may still work for any datatype
  where each constructor has at least one field.

An `M1` instance is always required (but it can just ignore the
meta-information).

## Putting the magic into the type classes

Having dealt with generic implementation of the functionality of interest,
let's put it all together and use a special GHC extension to allow the user
derive type classes without knowing anything about generics.

For a generic implementation to work without user's definition we need to
provide it as the default definition. As you have already seen, a generic
implementation often involves a `Generic` constraint and it would be ugly to
add it to every type class (on the left hand side of `=>`) just to make
deriving easier. The `default` keyword, enabled by the `DefaultSignatures`
language extension, allows us to give a different type signature for default
implementation of a type class:

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  default fmap :: (Generic1 f, Functor (Rep1 f)) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  fmap = to1 . fmap . from1

class CountFields a where
  countFields :: a -> Natural
  default countFields :: (Generic a, CountFields1 (Rep a)) => a -> Natural
  countFields = defaultCountFields
```

This way we can have our cake and eat it too: deriving is easy and otherwise
no ugly details are visible!

## Conclusion

Generics are a powerful means of automating error-prone and boring defining
of type class instances by hand. However, this feature is helpful beyond
just that use-case, as with a bit of creativity it allows us to reason about
data types generically (for example, we could calculate the number of
constructors at compile time), and generate values in a type safe way
(useful, for example, in combination with Quick Check's value generation).
Finally, there are quite a few very interesting packages that complement or
build on top of GHC generics. Once you feel comfortable with vanilla
generics, libraries
like [`generic-sop`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop) may
be of interest.
