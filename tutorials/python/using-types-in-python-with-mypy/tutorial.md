description: Learn how to improve software quality and readability in Python code by leveraging the built-in typing system, as it complements other software development processes like type-driven development and test-driven development.
---

_Type-Driven Development_ is a technique in which we write types for a program
before writing the program and then write code that satisfies the types, similar
to how in test-driven development we write tests before writing code that passes
the tests. It brings many benefits such as increasing robustness, accuracy,
testability, readability, and extensibility of your code by taking advantage of
the language’s type system.

In a [previous article][types-vs-tests], we discussed the benefits of working
with _Type-Driven Development_ and the importance of static type checking at
compilation time for strongly typed languages such as Haskell. Type-checking
strengthens our code and reduces the number of tests we need to write. As a
result, we are increasing our efficiency, whether if the paradigm is
object-oriented or functional programming.

## What about Python?

Is it possible to use a strong type system in a language like Python? The answer
is yes. [PEP-3107][pep-3107] and [PEP-484][pep-484] introduced _Type Annotations
to Python_ 3.5 back in 2014. It’s been a while, right? Why is this not more
popular? It's because Python, being a dynamic language, doesn’t require us to
write variable or return types explicitly. They’re completely optional and
mostly used by editors and IDEs.

In this article, we’ll be walking through the Python type system - how to add
types to our code and Docstrings and how to perform static type checking using
[mypy][mypy]. There are plenty of options for static type-checking in Python.
However, in this tutorial we will follow [Guido van Rossum's
suggestion][guido-mypy].

### Mypy

Mypy is a third-party Python library that provides optional static type
checking. Unlike other non-dynamic programming languages like Java, where the
static type-checking takes place at compilation time, Mypy CLI does the
type-check to a file (or a set of files) on-demand. Apart from type-checking at
development time, it's helpful to also include this check automatically in the
Continuous Integration pipeline.

To start using mypy, install it using any version of `pip` globally or in your
virtual environment:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

To perform static type checking on a source file:

```bash
mypy my_file.py
```

## Primitive types

You might know that programming languages can be statically or dynamically
typed. A statically typed language does type checking at compile-time while
dynamically typed language does it at run-time.

Another concept that is important to understand before we continue is the
difference between weakly and strongly typed languages. In short, a strongly
typed language has stricter rules such as variable assignment, return values,
and function calling, while weakly typed ones can produce unpredictable results.

That being said, Python is a multi-paradigm dynamic language, so the type of
variable is determined based on its value. This might be confusing, but it
doesn't mean that Python is _weakly typed_. Python is _strongly typed_.
Surprised? Check this out:

```python
movie = "Die Hard"
movie = movie + 2
# TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
```

Now that all of that is clear, let’s begin this tutorial with a basic example:

```python
meat = "Ground beef"
print(type(meat))
# <class 'str'>

weight_pounds = 0.5
print(type(weight_pounds))
# <class 'float'>
```

In the above example we are using the `type` function to inspect the type
representation of any variable. What if we include types in our first code
example? Let’s check out the following example:

```python
meat: str = "Ground beef"
weight_pounds: str = 0.5
```

If we execute this file we expect the same output as the previous one, but we
actually get the following:

```
error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "float", variable has type "str")
```

Did you catch the reason why the error was thrown? The variable `weight_pounds`
was defined as `str`, but we were assigning a float number to it. We can start
spotting bugs everytime we run the type checking process.

## The typing module

I’m pretty sure you’ll be able to understand this function:

```python
def make_hamburger(meat, number_of_meats):
   return ["bread"] + [meat] * number_of_meats + ["bread"]


print(make_hamburger("ground beef", 2))
# ['bread', 'ground beef', 'ground beef', 'bread']
```

Let’s see how it goes with types:

```python
from typing import List


def make_hamburger(meat: str, number_of_meats: int) -> List[str]:
   return ["bread"] + [meat] * number_of_meats + ["bread"]
```

What happened here? We defined the function’s arguments types: string for
`meat`, integer for `number_of_meats` and the return type, which is a list of
string values. Did you notice the import at the beginning? Non primitive types
such as `List`, `Dict` or `Tuple` must be imported from the `typing` module.

## Type Alias

You can also define your custom type names for known structures, which is very
useful for improving readability. If we wanted to specify that a hamburger is a
list of strings, we can define a type `Hamburger` in the following way:

```python
Hamburger = List[str]

def make_hamburger(meat: str, number_of_meats: int) -> Hamburger:
   return ["bread"] + [meat] * number_of_meats + ["bread"]
```

## Callables

A callable is anything you can call, using parentheses, and possibly with
passing arguments as well. Callables can be functions, classes, methods, or even
instances of classes (if their class implements a `__call__` method).

Are you working with functional programming? No problem, the typing library
includes a type for callables which accepts a two-dimensional list like
`[[argument1_type, … argumentN_type], return_type]`.

```python
from typing import Callable, Optional


def sum_and_process(a: int, b: int, callback: Callable[[int, Optional[str]], bool]) -> bool:
   total = a + b
   return callback(total, None)


def is_positive(val: int, message: Optional[str]) -> bool:
   if message:
       print(message)
   return val > 0


output = sum_and_process(5, 2, is_positive)
print(output)
# True
```

First of all, we are creating a function that takes two integer values, sums
them up, and returns the output of an incoming callback. The callback
`is_positive` is defined as a function that takes one mandatory integer and one
optional string. If the message exists it will print it, and it returns `true`
if the incoming value is greater than `0` (or `false` otherwise).

## Generics

Two of the most powerful features in a type system are generics and union types.
They are also available in Python's Type Annotations. Let’s take a look at the
following example:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, List


T = TypeVar("T", int, List[str])

def generic_add(x: T, y: T) -> T:
   return x + y


x1: int = 5
y1: int = 2
print(generic_add(x1, y1))
# 7

x2: List[str] = ["Hello"]
y2: List[str] = ["World"]
print(generic_add(x2, y2))
# ['Hello', 'World']

x3: str = "foo"
y3: str = "bar"
print(generic_add(x3, y3))
# error: Value of type variable "T" of "generic_add" cannot be "str"
```

To avoid ourselves from repeating code, we can make use of the `Any` type, but
we completely lose the information for the incoming types. Instead, we defined a
type variable `T` that can be an integer or a list of strings and a
`generic_add` function that performs the “addition” operation for the incoming
arguments, which are limited by the `TypeVar` declaration.

The first two invocations will work because we're passing arguments that belong
to the `TypeVar` set of types, and the function will behave accordingly since
both types implement the `+` operation. It will actually run for the third
invocation because Python has this same operation for strings. Still, mypy will
raise an error as `str` is not supported by the `T` definition.

## Union Types

We can also make use of union types. Let’s suppose we want to support any number
that can only be of the types integer and float:

```python
from typing import Union


Number = Union[float, int]

def union_add(x: Number, y: Number) -> Number:
   return x + y


x1: int = 5
y1: int = 2
print(union_add(x1, y1))
# 7

x2: float = 3.14
y2: float = 3.14
print(union_add(x2, y2))
# 6.28

x3: str = "2"
y3: str = "1"
print(union_add(x3, y3))
# error: Argument 1 to "union_add" has incompatible type "str"; expected "Union[float, int]"
# error: Argument 2 to "union_add" has incompatible type "str"; expected "Union[float, int]"
```

## Conclusion

Using static types will help us to prevent bugs and implementation issues by
proving program consistency. It also allows us to use Type-Driven Development,
and by doing this we decrease the amount of unit tests that we need to write.
The difference with Test-Driven Development is that "unlike tests, which can
usually only be used to show the _presence_ of errors, types (used
appropriately) can show the _absence_ of errors. But although types _reduce_ the
need for tests, they rarely eliminate it entirely" (Brady, 2017, p.3).

For a deeper dive into Type-Driven Development, we suggest books like
[_Type-Driven Development with Idris_][tdd-idris]. Idris allows for more
expressive types than Python, but many of the concepts in the book can be used
in Python and other languages.

If you are concerned about program performance being affected by using Type
Annotations, there’s no need to be since Python doesn't check the types during
execution time. Loading the `typing` library does add some overhead during
development, but the effect is negligible. Because of this, types are available
in development for many [use cases][function-annotations] such as function
overloading, adaptation, database query mapping and meta-programming.

Are you ready to start adding types in Python? If the answer is yes, let’s
create robust and type-safe code by using Type Annotations. The first thing that
you will start noticing is how the runtime bugs decrease. Please check out the
official Python [documentation for typings][python-docs]. There you can find
examples for other structures such as `Tuples`, `Dict`, `Generator`, and
inheritance. If you are interested in sharing another technique to complement
